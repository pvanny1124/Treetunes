# Treetunes

In this project, I examined how to style a simple playlist and add functionality to its buttons using javaScript.

I also learned how to create functions and methods using the "prototype" keyword, how to encapsulate data, how to inherit methods from other functions using the call() function and the Object.create() method, how to use the "this" keyword for objects, how to get DOM elements and add specific functions on different user interactions, how to insert an html string into a DOM element.
